## Intro : 
Here, we'll learn about the structure of Built-in Data Structures of Java.

Here's the Hierarchical Information About Java Interfaces, classes etc.

# Collection Framework :

### **Collection**
is internally an Interface that provides the definition of common methods for collection Data Types.<br> As we know, these methods of interfaces must be implemented in the classes implementing it.

The root interface in the collection hierarchy. A collection represents a group of objects, known as its elements. Some collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered and others unordered. etc.

This is extended by the **List Interface**. 

## Elements of Collection Framework.

Other Interfaces that extends Collection. Also classes in these Hierarchy provides functionaliy of a Collection Data Structure.

i.e. List, Set, Vector, ArrayList, Stack, Queue etc.

## **Enums :**

In Java, an enum (short for enumeration) is a special data type that is used to define a collection of constant values. Enumerations serve the purpose of defining a set of named constants that represent distinct values or elements. They provide a way to create a group of related named constants in a more structured and type-safe manner.

* They are implicitly public, static & final.
* They can be easily Iterable.
* Elements of Enums are named constants called enum constants.
