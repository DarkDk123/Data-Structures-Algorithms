# **Lecture 44 - Linked List Interview Questions**

We'll do **linked List questions** here, including all the concepts, approaches and tips for achieving that solution.

### Q.1 Insert at End of a Linked List Using Recursion.
I've copied the previous implementation of Linked List. And Inserted a method to insert at the end using Recursion.

It's in the file [Here](./Q1_Custom_LL.java#L233).

### Q.2 Insert at given index using recursion. 
My Solution [here](./Q1_Custom_LL.java#L265).

Instructor's solution is so clean, you should visit that [Here](https://github.com/kunal-kushwaha/DSA-Bootcamp-Java/blob/325361dd2e9ab2d50bc7d2eeefada97d3d9db0d0/lectures/18-linkedlist/code/src/com/kunal/LL.java#L57)
