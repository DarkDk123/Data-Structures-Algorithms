***Note :*** I'll mostly write code only from now, due to limited time. The Explanations will be in code files mainly.

## **Linked List**

A Linked List is an ordered list of objects, where each of it's elements is connected to each other via pointers **(ref. variables)**.
    
These elements are stored at different locations making it reliable for non-contiguous memory locations.

**Terms :**

1. **Node :** A Node is just an element or object of the Linked List **(LL)**.
2. **Head :** Head of a Linked List is the starting node of the "LL".
3. **Tail :** Tail of a Linked List is the ending node of the "LL".


### **Singly linked list**
A Linked List connected singly to the next node only is known as a singly linked list.
It consists of **Node Value & Next Node** only.

Inbuilt Linked List - provided by java. [Example](./InBuilt_LL.java)

Custom Linked List - [Example](./CustomLinkedList/Custom_LL.java)

### **Doubly linked list**

A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, just in doubly LL, we also have ref. variables in each Node pointing to previous Node.

It consists of **Node Value, Next Node & Previous Node.**

Custom doubly Linked List - [Example](./CustomDoublyLinkedList/Doubly_LL.java)
