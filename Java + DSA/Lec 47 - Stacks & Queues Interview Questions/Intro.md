## Stack & Queues Interview Question

Here, I will list out the Interview Questions done for Stacks and Queues


### How to consider using Queue or Stack!?

* When working with ordering of elements!
* Working with sequences.
* Storing values at different levels.
* Storing values to use later!
* etc. many more!


### Questions!

1. Implement **Queue** using **Two Stacks** ! **([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/))**
   
   Code is Here [1](./QueueUsingStacks.java), [2](./QueueUsingStacks2.java).

   There is also a more efficient way - [**Amortized Analysis.**](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1169404480/)  

2. The Game of two Stacks ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-two-stacks/problem)).
   
   The code is [here](./GameOfTwoStacks.java) with locally generated test cases!

   I'm just skipping the submission part here, it's bit complex & i'm just not coding in HackerRank.

3. Largest Rectangle in Histogram ([LeetCode Hard](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/))
   
   Code is [Here](./LargestRectangle.java).

4. Valid Parentheses ([LeetCode Easy](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)).

   The Solution is [Here](./ValidParentheses.java).

5. Make Parentheses Valid ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid/))
   
   The Solution is [Here](./MakeParenthesesValid.java).

6. Make Parentheses balanced ([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertions-to-balance-a-parentheses-string/))

   The Solution is [Here](./MakeParenthesesBalanced.java).

In middle, i revised the lecture (coming after a long time)!
**Refreshed this lecture**
* **Solved following problems with different approaches**
    * **Queue with Stacks (Amortized)**
    * **Stack with Queues**
    * **Stack with Single Queue** (space-optimized)
    * **Python Queue** (implementation)

From now on, i'll continue to complete next lectures, at a decent speed!
