### Questions!

1. Implement **Queue** using **Two Stacks** ! **([LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/))**
   
   Code is Here [1](./QueueUsingStacks.java), [2](./QueueUsingStacks2.java).

   There is also a more efficient way - [**Amortized Analysis.**](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1169404480/)  

2. The Game of two Stacks ([HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/game-of-two-stacks/problem)).
   
   The code is [here](./GameOfTwoStacks.java) with locally generated test cases!

   I'm just skipping the submission part here, it's bit complex & i'm just not coding in HackerRank.
