# Stacks

Stack are Data Structures that follow **LIFO** or **FILO** order for insert/pop operations. Examples of Stack are:

* **Imagine a pile of plates:** You add plates on top and remove them from the top only. This is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
  
* **Think of undo/redo buttons:** Each new action is added to the "stack," and undoing removes the most recent one.
  
* **Used for:** Balancing parentheses, backtracking algorithms, function call execution.

# Queue

Queues on the other hand are Data structures that provides **2 Ends** for performing operations. It follows **LILO** or **FIFO** Order in Enqueue/Dequeue operations. Examples of Queue are:

* **Picture a line at a coffee shop:** People arrive at the back and leave from the front. This is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
  
* **Imagine processing tasks in a printer queue:** Jobs get added to the back and printed in the order they arrived.
  
* **Used for:** Breadth-first search algorithms, handling network requests, managing job scheduling.

### Other uses:

* Used wherever we need to store something, past operations etc.
* In Searching techniques.
* To convert Recursion programs into Iteration.

# Deque

A Deque is a "type of queue" that provides additional functionality for inserting and removing items.

It provides operations to remove and insert elements to both ends of the structure (queue).

We can insert and remove items to both rear and back of the structure.

### The built-in code for this data structures are used in the file [here]().
