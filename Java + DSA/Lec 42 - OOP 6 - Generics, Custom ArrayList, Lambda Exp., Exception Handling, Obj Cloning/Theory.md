### **Now that we know OOP Core Concepts, let's create Our Custom ArrayList:**

## Custom ArrayList : 
Custom ArrayList replicating the functionality of built-in ArrayList Type. By Implementing various methods and techniques.

The List we created in "CustomListExample.java" file, it's not worth it.

Cause it can work only with "int" data types<br>
Even if we adapt it to multiple data types, we we'll have to change almost 90% of our code!!

This problem will be solved using Generics.
