### This Lecture will be Focused : 

**Access Control, In-built packages, object Class etc.**

This section will talk in deep about the concept of Encapsulation as discussed in the last section.


**1. Access Control :** It refers to the allowed access to the program contents i.e. objects, methods, classes & variables, etc. 

How these things can be accessed from outside and within the classes is determined by Access Control mechanism.

`private, public, protected & default` keywords are used to control access to the program contents in Java.

* we can Access the `private` data & methods by the use of *getters & setters.*

* `Protected` members are only accessible via Inheritance (Even if in the same package).

### **Packages :**  
A Java package is a directory that contains a collection of classes, interfaces, and subpackages. It provides a mechanism to group related classes and manage their accessibility. The package statement at the beginning of a Java source file indicates the package to which the class or interface belongs.


**Types :**
1. User Defined Packages. 2. Built-in Packages.


### **Object Class :** 

It's the top class in the *Class hierarchy*, and every java class is automatically inherited from the **Object Class**.
